Landsat data extraction pseudocode

#different sensors/sattelites have different band designations, 
#so do each one at a atime


function 'processImage'
	extract everything (r system() command) into temp folder unique to process
	read metadata (date aquired, spacecraft, sensor, total cloud cover)
		(can get everything above cept cloud cover from the filename)
	for each image file
		bands1-7, cloud_qa, 
		extract data from points shapefile
		return data

	delete unique temp folder
		

get list of files (single image tar.gz file)
foreach in list 

#############################################
landsat data file format
1 line for each pixel, plots can have multiple pixels

sensor, year, doy, cvmask, band1, band2, band3, band4, band5, band6, band7, sensor

general notes

-pixel locations look to be standerdized across all image times, and
across different sattellites so there is no 'pixel drift'. this is good.  very good. 

-89 was a grassy year!

##############################################
To Do

-shrub transect excel files from 2004 & 2009 will need some special attention. 
each plot got it's own table with no obvious notes

-transect data from 89-95. Need to adjust species names a bit. catagorize into functional group (shrub, annual grass, annual forb, etc).
