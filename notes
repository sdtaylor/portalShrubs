Landsat data extraction pseudocode

#different sensors/sattelites have different band designations, 
#so do each one at a atime

for thisSensor in (LS5, LS8)
get list of files (single image tar.gz file)

for each file
	extract everything (r system() command) into temp folder unique to process
	read metadata (date aquired, spacecraft, sensor, total cloud cover)
		(can get everything above cept cloud cover from the filename)
	for each image file
		bands1-7, cloud_qa, 
		extract data from points shapefile
		return data

	delete unique temp folder

general notes

-pixel locations look to be standerdized across all image times, and
across different sattellites so there is no 'pixel drift'. this is good.  very good.

To Do

-need to ask about GPS points of plot corners. some of the plots are hard to 
draw from the NAIP imagery
